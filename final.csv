The failure to use the locking nut adapter properly, thereby destroying it and leaving me with no way to remove and replace wheels - not so good.

1529,Questionable buying process and a terrible fitting experience. Firstly the purchasing experience was not great. I entered my registration and was shown the tyres that were supposedly suitable for my car. I was looking for the same Bridgestone S001 run flat tyres. The S001 tyres appeared at the top of the search results and seemed a good price. I ordered them. Instantly I got an email from [REDACTED] saying they think I have ordered the wrong tyres and they ones I ordered were non run flats and my car would have run flats. Looking at the website again the correct tyres were 4 pages down in the search results and a total of £65 more expensive. Clearly the system knew at the time of checkout that I had potentially the wrong tyres as I got an automated email from them only once I had placed an order!! Trapped why not ask at the time of checkout!!! Had to pay the extra money which then took the total price to more than other quotes I had received.Then onto the fitting. The garage is only a few mins from my house. Booked for 8am on a Saturday. Arrived 7:50am. It then took 1 hour 45 mins to fit 2 tyres. Not impressed. Then when I drove away after that long wait my car warned me that the pressure in the drivers rear tyre was too low. It had about 10 psi less than the rest! So either the garage did not put enough in or the tyre was leaking air. Went back to the garage to get it checked out. No leak just not enough air put in (very dangerous). Drove away a second time to see that this time the same tyre still did not have enough air in it to match the rest of the tyres. I ended up going to a petrol garage and fixing the issue myself with the air pump. Small point also was that my alloys and tyres were absolutely covered in the white tyre lub. You expect some but the alloy was smothered in it. So had to take the car to the cleaners also.So in summary questionable buying process and a terrible fitting experience.,garage service,negative

1532,Questionable buying process and a terrible fitting experience. Firstly the purchasing experience was not great. I entered my registration and was shown the tyres that were supposedly suitable for my car. I was looking for the same Bridgestone S001 run flat tyres. The S001 tyres appeared at the top of the search results and seemed a good price. I ordered them. Instantly I got an email from [REDACTED] saying they think I have ordered the wrong tyres and they ones I ordered were non run flats and my car would have run flats. Looking at the website again the correct tyres were 4 pages down in the search results and a total of £65 more expensive. Clearly the system knew at the time of checkout that I had potentially the wrong tyres as I got an automated email from them only once I had placed an order!! Trapped why not ask at the time of checkout!!! Had to pay the extra money which then took the total price to more than other quotes I had received.Then onto the fitting. The garage is only a few mins from my house. Booked for 8am on a Saturday. Arrived 7:50am. It then took 1 hour 45 mins to fit 2 tyres. Not impressed. Then when I drove away after that long wait my car warned me that the pressure in the drivers rear tyre was too low. It had about 10 psi less than the rest! So either the garage did not put enough in or the tyre was leaking air. Went back to the garage to get it checked out. No leak just not enough air put in (very dangerous).

1540,"[REDACTED] OK McConechys not OK. Ordered up my new tyres from [REDACTED] online, good price and good prompt service from [REDACTED]. However, I made a massive mistake in choosing McConechy's, Sighthill, Edinburgh as the nominated tyre fitters. It is clear that as a [REDACTED] customer and not an actual McConechy's customer appearing at their workplace wanting your tyres fitted, you are in actual fact an annoyance to them and you are getting in their way.McConechy's fitted my tyres (although I'm very sure reluctantly).Upon being told by the tyre fitter that my car was now ready to go, I walked up to the car and noticed that there was no dustcaps fitted and had to request that 2 new dustcaps be fitted. I then left after being handed my tyre fitting paperwork.A day later I was checking the air pressures of my new tyres and then also noticed that McConechy's had not even changed the valve stems either. I contacted McConechy's about this and it was the tyre fitter that done the work that answered the phone. I told him that I noticed they had not changed the valve stems. I got this pathetic excuse about my existing valve stems being metal ones and he did not think I would have wanted rubber valve stems fitted, so he did not bother to change them and as an afterthought he stated ""but I changed the valve cores though"".I don't believe a word of that, what the tyre fitter guy doesn't know, is that I'm a fully qualified engineer and I know corner cutting when I see it. Remember I had to actually request that they fit dustcaps. Unfortunately I didn't notice McConechy's had not changed the valve stems at that time or I would have pulled them up right there and then.I know why he didn't change the valve stems, it is because they are all rusted up, badly corroded and might take a bit longer to remove and change over, maybe even some other problems that's why they were not changed and not his BS story about them being metal.I paid for 2 new tyres fitted and balanced with new valve stems and new valves fitted. That is not what I got.I got 2 new tyres fitted and balanced without new valve stems and a story that I don't believe about the valve cores being changed.But that makes it OK doesn't it ? NO, it certainly doesn't !I was also supposed to have a free wheel alignment check done, the McConechy's fitter never made any mention of this. I had already decided not to go ahead with the alignment check anyway.Also states on the tyre fitting paperwork that the wheel nuts were torqued to 110nm. Well when I checked them 50 miles later, the wheel nuts were all at very different torque levels, the locking wheel nuts being the tightest by far.I do not believe for 1 second that the wheels were even torqued in the first place, more like slammed back on and racked up with the air gun. There is no way the wheel nuts seen a torque wrench. The McConechy's tyre fitter was/is a story telling corner cutter. Avoid them, you are not a McConechy's customer, you are an annoyance to them, you are getting in their way. Not at all happy with any of this.Steven Dryden.",damage,negative

1650,"Having a BMW with staggered wheels it's very difficult to find x 2 pairs of the same tyre in the same place. I was thinking of removing the run flat tyres from our F31 330d for many reasons but this was a job for the future...... until on my way home from work 2 days before we went on Holiday to France I picked up a puncture. The annoying thing was, the tyres x 4 had loads of life left on them so I had to bite the bullet and change all 4. [REDACTED] were amazing, they were quick and professional even to the point where they had realised that I had ordered non runflat tyres and sent me a warning Email in case I was not aware of my error.

1655,"Firstly, my tyre was not available on the day I booked. The day before my appointment, I was contacted as the delivery could not be made by the allotted time. This seems like rather poor planning on [REDACTED]' part. I had to change my weekend plans and miss an important event because I couldn't drive the long distance on my tyre that needed to be replaced. Secondly, the available locations were confusing, as there were multiple locations for the same business (Charles Hurst). Having chosen one, when I went to the business on the day, no one seemed to be aware of my booking - either in the chosen location, or in the second location I was sent to. Only the tyre that I had ordered (which turned up at the second location without any mention of a booking) led to the staff at the second location being aware of the booking, and so they were able to carry out the tyre change. The booking system appeared robust and I was pleased with the price, the people at the garage were courteous and the service provided at the garage was good, but the above two points really annoyed me.",garage service,positive

They then decided it was time to take my vehicle into the workshop and eventually after 50 minutes the job was done. I do not excpect to wait 50 minutes for 2 tyres to be replaced.

I needed tires fitted at the weekend as mine were severely worn according to my MOT and I had a number of journeys to make with some pretty appalling weather forecaster. A friend suggested I check out [REDACTED], the prices looked great and a good range of local garages (5 within 6 miles or so of me) so I went ahead and placed an order.

I replied and asked them to look at other garages in the area as I needed them fitted that weekend. About an hour later I received a follow up email telling me it was too late for them to deliver the tires to any other garage for the following afternoon and that the next available appointment was now Wednesday! I asked for my money to be refunded and figured I would just book myself in with a local garage instead as they had plenty of spaces to do the fitting when i needed it. Heard nothing back and no refund which meant I couldn't book in at the local garage instead. Followed up on the Monday to the customer service department and again heard nothing back. I ended up having to send an email to a different department, along with a complaint which resulted in my payment being refunded.

2491,"I have used you in the past and had excellent service, the past company I had the tyres fitted at were excellent, but no longer one of your options for fitting now. I chose your premium fitter in Basingstoke, Formula One Auto - and they were awful. Their customer service was non existent. I phoned up and got a quote for having the wheels tracked, they quoted £36 for front and £52 for front and back if needed, but I probably only had the fronts that it was possible to do. With this I sent my husband to have the tyres fitted, so when they charged him £48 he paid assuming it had been front and back that needed. They took nearly 23 hours from our apointment to fit the tyres, way longer than it should have for 4 tyres. I phoned them and said that the paperwork clearly stated only the front had been balanced and was given a wishy washy excuse for the over charge, which, because I know about cars I knew to be rubbish, he then said that they couldn't refund the over charge directly and needed to have a cheque sent to me, which I would get in a week. I then discovered the next day when I took the car out for a drive that they had under inflated all of the tyres by 5 to 7 psi. After 10 days I phoned back and advised the regional manager who answered the phone at the branch about the under inlfation and that the cheque had not arrived. I was promised a call back, which never came. A week later I chased again, again promised a call back and again did not hear from them. A few days later I called again and got the regional manager again who promised a call back, but still did not call. a few days later I eventually got the cheque refund through. The tyres themselves are good, but the company who represents you for fitting is by far one of the worse and clearly try to take advantage of people who they think know nothing about cars. Thankfully although my husband doesn't I do, it is disgusting that they tried to take advantage and over charge people. So for that reason whilst I may still recommend [REDACTED] for tyres I would be very, very, very careful about who fits mine in the future and advise anyone else to be too.",balancing,negative

The only time this service doesn't work is if you need to replace a tire due to a puncture or damage. A great service and very easy and if you have any issues communication from [REDACTED] is easy. Even the garages don't mind you using them. Thanks for the service,ease of booking,positive

The garage has scheduled a fitting for you on 06/08/2019 (Tuesday) at for AM appointment, please let me know if this is not suitable and we can look into alternatives to fit in with your schedule. Once again I am very sorry for the delays that have been caused on this order. We will be looking into how such delays can be avoided again in the future and prevent inconvenience to our customers. Thanks, Vasim Terence, Jul 30, 17:41 BST: Dear. Martin, I am sorry to advise that we have encountered a delay in delivering your tyres in time for your requested fitting tomorrow. Due to the delay we are no longer able to honor your scheduled appointment time, at this stage we would now be looking to reschedule your appointment from 02/08/2019 (Friday) onward to allow us time to rectify the delay and ensure your tyres are at the garage. Could you please advise a suitable time and date from 02/08/2019 (Friday) onward that I would be able to re-schedule your appointment to and I will action this with your chosen garage and send over an updated conformation email. You can either reply to this email or you can call us on 01721 540650. We are open until 5:30pm on weekdays, I appreciate that this is short notice however we have only just been made aware that the tyres have not been delivered and understand this is frustrating. Once again, I am very sorry for the inconvenience caused, please be assured that we will continue to work to resolve this as quickly as possible for you.

I complained at the timeabout the time it took took replace the 4 tyres. - 15/08. Started vehicle at 7.30am to drive to work. Tyre pressure warning light came on so checked tyres. Rear driver side tyre low as tyre was leaking air. Also noticed the tyre fitters had damaged wheels. Had to drive to the fitters to sort out air leak and complained about fresh damage to wheels. Took abou half for them to sort wheels and decided I would complain in writing rather than confront the fitters as at the time I was and am fuming. - 15/08. MOT booked in with BMW. Car passed MOT. However I was advised that the front brake pad warning wire was hanging. Had to book car in again on the 18/08 to be rectified.19/08. BMW checked the front brake pad warning wire. Brake Pads and discs replaced by BMW in March and was advised by BMW that the front brake pad warning compartment was cracked and the wire left hanging when the tyres were changed.Im not one to complain. However all the above are unacceptable.I will be pursuing this......,garage service,negative

3096,"A bit of a mixed bag of goodbadgreat. A bit of a mixed bag in terms of overall experience I'm afraid, so lower rating than I anticipated. Finding and paying for the tires online, including the actual price for high grade Michelins, was all very good...things just fell apart after choosing the deliver and fit option to a local (big name) garage. Using the online booking too was a doddle but within 24hrs I had an email saying the time was no longer any good as the garage was fully booked. Then the customer service for alternative provision was basically picked for me from a few days/times I offered (a week later than my original slot mind you!). The worst part however was taking time of work to visit the garage only to be told 'they don't book tire fitting at their garage' and basically being told to wait in line for 45 mins behind the drive-in customers?! Bit pointless having a booking system and they fully blamed [REDACTED] for offering something online that well basically, wasn't offered in the real world. I have to say on the garage's part though they were excellent when I returned after about 40 mins and did the 2x tires very quickly and capably, so the eventual service was great.

Well having used [REDACTED] before I opted to purchase some fully fitted tyres from them.Got the confirmation email and booking for fitting, so I took half day off work to allow, very late email arrives saying delay and so booking moved a day forward. So another half day booked and what another late email saying can’t actually get hold of tyres? I rang their customer services who had no sympathy at all for 2 half days being booked and they could offer me cheaper tyres at the same price of which I refused. I explained that my chosen tyres were still on sale on their website but for some reason were almost £20 more for each tyre, could this be the reason? Who knows, anyway I had to opt for different tyres to be fitted which meant another delay and more time off work.

3271,No notice of being unable to fit tyres offered fitting five days later. Ordered a Tyre for my daughters car as existing tyre irreparable. As no spare until replaced could not drive car. Ordered on Weds for fitting Saturday morning. Received an e mail at 7.51 am about feedback and another at 7.52 stating that the tyre could not be fitted on Saturday and the earliest date for fitting would be five days later on Weds. During this time my daughter would have no driveable car. She needed the car on Saturday. This meant I had little chance of finding a local tyre fitter to fit a tyre on the busiest morning of the week and certainly not at a competitive price. Very poor service to be told just before fitting time the order could not be fulfilled. Ended up paying a premium to get a tyre fitted on the Saturday.,value for money,negative

I am glad I did as the whole process has been very smooth and I have been very satisfied. Perhaps some acknowledgement that the order is on its way would be an improvement to the service, as it was a day later than predicted and I ended up asking where it was on the day it was delivered. That would be a time saving on both sides I would suggest.My experience may be better than some, since I did not have them sent to a fitting station, preferring to use my very reliable local garage(Bitz) for this, as I had no deadline to meet to get them fitted.I would be very happy to use this company again.",garage service,positive

Having already paid for the tyres + fitting I had no choice but to load up the 4 tyres and drive 3 junctions down the Motorway to another affiliated garage and have them fitted that afternoon.. Wasted my day.There's no point being able to order on-line if the the computer does'nt recognise and decline unsuitable vehicles at the point of purchase.

The staff were critical of their boss who had supplied them with innapropriate lifting equipment which they don't use. Having already paid for the tyres + fitting I had no choice but to load up the 4 tyres and drive 3 junctions down the Motorway to another affiliated garage and have them fitted that afternoon.. Wasted my day.There's no point being able to order on-line if the the computer does'nt recognise and decline unsuitable vehicles at the point of purchase. If in doubt I suggest you contact your local [REDACTED] prior to ordering on-line to save a wasted journey.

The garage said yeah no problem we can do it Saturday? So let's wait and see what happens. Avoid like the plague.,response time,negative

Phone them the next day, waited 10 minutes before I was answered and apologised to me saying that I can get them fitted on Friday at the same time as my Wednesday appointment had been. Friday comes and I get to the fitter who tells me that they have only had 3 tyres delivered of the 4 I ordered and paid for. I ended up having the three fitted and left the best one of the previous 4 on. I phoned them whilst I was at the fitter. They apologised again and said that they will refund the 4th tyre, Give me £20 off and also a 10% voucher for when next I use them. Of course that was just to fob me off and I only received the refund for the tyre. Not a happy customer and will rather pay more per tyre at another provider than get messed around by this rather unimpressive outfit.",change of date,negative

They finally agreed not to charge me extra so I asked about tracking but they would only do that if i replaced both front tyres and they would charge extra for that on top of the normal price for tracking. I declined that and went else where for the tracking. There was a young boy changing the tyres who moved so slow and kept yawning.,garage service,negative

4683,"Trouble free from choosing to fitting. This was my 1st experience in buying tyres online and I have to say I'm totally pleased that I chose [REDACTED].The process of comparing, choosing and reading up about the tyres in my size and price range is very helpful and simple to do. They have several top Brands and a large overall choice.And that also goes for choosing the garage and appointment time/date that suits me.You chose the garage and your chosen tyres will be there waiting for you when you arrive.

There was no explanation for the delay and they rebooked me a new slot without even phoning me to discuss a suitable day. As a result I had to take a day off work to accommodate this as I couldn’t postpone the fitting any longer.

Totally unacceptable. It was too late to contact [REDACTED] then so we phoned Saturday morning and was told the fitter would come that morning as arranged. We agreed to that but said we had to travel to Manchester at lunchtime. No-one had turned up by 11.45 so we phoned again and was told fitter would be with us by 1.00-1.15. Still no show, so phoned again at 2.00pm and was told he would be with us by 3.00pm. Still no show so we left home, making alternative travel arrangements and being disappointingly late for the event we had planned. Rang [REDACTED] again Monday morning and was told fitter would come at 1.00pm. He finally arrived at 3.45 that afternoon.

I have also never had any problems when I have attended one of their many fitting partners - also have the option for the fitters to come to the customer for a reasonable £6 extra charge - I’ve never used that option so can’t comment on its quality.

I went to a different garage later that day as I needed the fronts urgently and couldn’t wait for your delivery time and they used a nut gun and didn’t removed the old wheel weights before balancing.

That was less convenient.The supplier selected was the nearest & most convenient but they were a mainstream BMW garage and not a specialist tyre fitter. They were clearly more focused on their BMW customers and despite clear instructions fitted the replacement tyre on the wrong wheel. This was apologetically rectified but resulted in the fitting of one tyre taking 2 hours.

As usual, I took a screen-shot of the 'Order confirmation' screen showing these details for my records. Shortly afterwards I received an email confirmation from [REDACTED] which indicated that I had ordered a BMW Run-flat version of the Dunlop SP Sport Maxx. I rang to query this and although the sales person was very pleasant he seemed unable to accept that I had not ordered the BMW Run-flat version. Even after I emailed a copy of my screen-shot and then cancelled the order he still insisted that their ordering screen and systems are quite clear and that I must have accidentally ordered the wrong tyre. (Sub-text; another stupid customer!)I have since re-run my attempt to order this tyre and I suggest that [REDACTED] may benefit from re-designing their ordering screen and de-bugging their 'Order Confirmation' screen. After you enter a tyre number (AND the vehicle that the tyre is for!), the order-screen offers a number of boxes in rows of three which feature various brands of that tyre size. The large, headline text of these boxes are the brand and the price then the classified name of the tyre (in my case 'Dunlop SP Sport Maxx GT' followed by some generic (and therefore worthless) 4 and 5-star reviews. Between the 5-star review and the price is a narrow ruled-off area with one or more unexplained icons and logos. All the offered brands seem to have a tiny black car icon, presumably to indicate to the totally confused among us that the tyres are for a car rather than a bicycle or an airplane. Some of the tyres then have various car logos - BMW, Mercedes, Ferrari etc as well as 'Run Flat', and MO. There is no explanation as to whether there is something special about the Dunlop SP Sport Maxx GT tyre with a BMW logo that makes it only suitable for a BMW, and how can that be anyway? And if it is, why do they offer it in response to an inquiry for a Mercedes tyre, which is one of the compulsory fields in the ordering screen? And if these symbols are critical to the correct ordering of a tyre specific to a particular vehicle then wouldn't it be sensible for them to be much larger and with their relevance explained?Then, having allowed customers to order a tyre specific to a particular vehicle, why doesn't the 'Order confirmation' screen include that fact? If I hadn't checked the confirmation email carefully I could have easily ended up with the wrong tyre on my car.So, if [REDACTED] want me to try them again they need to let me know that they have either amended these issues or explained why they don't need to.",booking confusion,negative

There is no explanation as to whether there is something special about the Dunlop SP Sport Maxx GT tyre with a BMW logo that makes it only suitable for a BMW, and how can that be anyway? And if it is, why do they offer it in response to an inquiry for a Mercedes tyre, which is one of the compulsory fields in the ordering screen? And if these symbols are critical to the correct ordering of a tyre specific to a particular vehicle then wouldn't it be sensible for them to be much larger and with their relevance explained?Then, having allowed customers to order a tyre specific to a particular vehicle, why doesn't the 'Order confirmation' screen include that fact? If I hadn't checked the confirmation email carefully I could have easily ended up with the wrong tyre on my car.So, if [REDACTED] want me to try them again they need to let me know that they have either amended these issues or explained why they don't need to.",ease of booking,negative

I was desperate to get some tyres for the next day after picking up a puncture on the Thursday and having a weekend trip leaving on the Friday night and it's amazing how hard it is to get decent sport tyres for the next day as no-one carries stock. I'd first tried making a booking with Kwik Fit mobile fittings, they rejected it halfway through the booking process but then charged me for it and it took a week to get my money back. The only other place I could find was [REDACTED].com - they were offering good sport tyres next day at a very reasonable price to be fitted at the local HiQ garage. It seemed too good to be true, HiQ themselves charged more money and couldn't do it till the next Tuesday yet [REDACTED] could get the tyres to them for the next day for a cheaper price. The reviews looked good so I took my chances and it was all smooth sailing. The appointment was first thing the next morning, tyres arrived no problem and by 10am the job was done. It does seem a very good service that puts the major tyre shops like National to shame who can only get tyres to their centres in 2-3 days, plus the price is very good, so I will certainly look to [REDACTED].com again in the future.",value for money,positive

I didn't want to pay the normal price as I had just had to buy one.The [REDACTED] Web site was easy to use and gave the option of a few budget tyres. I shose the cheapest as it is only a spare and ordered it having chisel one of their premier fitters. The fitting time came through which was not convenient so called [REDACTED] who quickly rearranged the time for me.Turned up and immediately the wheel was taken, the new tyre fitted and balanced and then bought back to the car and put in the boot.

Unfortunately, no follow up the next day. An email sent to them.. and another one. Still no reply... - Right, looks like I will need to ring them, I thought.

The next morning I decided I'm not going to deal with them via email any more, and just headed (without an appointment) to the garage in question and asked if they had received my tyres (they had).

Received confirmation email but didn’t contain a time slot. Chased this up with them and reply said AM before midday. Day before I got an email around 5pm to advise they can’t fulfil my order and they’ve cancelled my booking with garage. Attempted to move it to another date that I couldn’t attend due to work. Told them to cancel and requested a refund. Next day (original day of garage booking), I received a text / email advising tires have now arrived at garage and that I can call along to get them fitted. Arrived at garage who informed me tires had been there for three days! Very very poor customer service, messed me about and made me late for work. If it wasn’t for the discount provided via Direct Line I wouldn’t have used this company and doubt I will in future.",late notice,negative

Email came back later the same day with a 5pm time slot. Got to tyre fitters and they said they could not get wheels off to change tyres due to stripped locking wheel but key. Said they couldn’t do it as they closed at 6pm and it was now 5:45pm. They requested I get lockers removed and then come back. I asked about making another appointment and they told me it would be an issue holding the tyres or getting them fitted when I got back. The next day I was able to get one of the nuts off by myself but was unable to get other off. Went to another garage over weekend who got it off. Took car back to tyre fitters and they fitted new tryres without a problem.

When I complained they then only gave me 10% off my NEXT purchase when they should clearly know there it will not be a next purchase, I wanted money off my current purchase but they said no for a reason they couldn’t explain, the communication was awful, I was emailing them and getting a new person reply to me each time not knowing what was going on, I had to repeat myself so many times when it should be their job to read back on pervious emails.

12071,"Purchased on the behalf of a vehicle workshop. Order placed on Monday at 11.55am for 2 tyres at over £400, promised delivery of Tuesday next day. I received an apologetic email and a voicemail outside of office hours at 5.35pm Monday, that stated the tyres would not arrive Tuesday but Wednesday instead. Contacted [REDACTED] on the phoneline on Thursday PM after realising that we had not yet had a delivery. The call handler explained that there had been a courier issue and that the tyres could not be supplied until the following Monday, 7 days after initial order. They were apologetic that I had not been contacted but couldn't offer an explanation as to why I was not informed that delivery would be delayed. Although the call handler was apologetic, it was explained that these tyres were for a client vehicle and had caused a delay in it being returned to the customer. I was offered 10% discount on next order, which I did not accept. As a gesture of goodwill it is lovely but doesn't help with the current issue & let down client. I have now sourced the tyres elsewhere, which have been delivered on Friday (today). It has taken 13mins on hold at peak time to cancel the order, (please change the on hold music :) !) but credit to both call handlers who chased the order, courier, and cancelled the order. Both very professional and did their best to assist. Just a shame that we haven't been looked after as a business in this instance",advisor/agent service,positive

12154,The ordering process is very easy to use and convenient. It allows you to book a fitting at the nearest garage. I placed the order on Wednesday for a Friday fitting. On Thursday afternoon I received an email stating there was an issue delivering my tyre to the garage and that my fitting was being rebooked to Tuesday. I had to phone [REDACTED] as I had already made arrangements and taken time off work to have the fitting on Friday. I am reliant on my vehicle for transport to work and of course this meant that I would be without a vehicle for another 4 days!. [REDACTED] were unable to keep the Friday booking and I was offered a small compensation by the rep on the phone. I kept the booking on Tuesday as the tyre which I ordered was only available through [REDACTED]. Come Tuesday there was no further problems the garage I chose was spot on. I awaited the compensation to be refunded back. Another week goes by and there was no sign of any compensation or any communication. So I rang [REDACTED] who told me there was no note on their system regarding me being given any compo.This was sorted the following day and I did receive the amount promised.Overall I would say this was a rough ride ordering from [REDACTED]. It's a shame they are failing at such little things and leave you stranded. The whole point of ordering a tyre from the internet is so that it is convenient and reliable. Unfortunately I can't say this about [REDACTED] at this point in time.If you are pushed for time I would rather recommend going to a local garage and pay the premium but get your tyres done the same day.,ease of booking,positive

12443,"Not very interested. I have recently had tyres fitted at Tweeddale Motors in Peebles, my second visit through [REDACTED] and they are absolutely fantastic! Friendly efficient and a pleasure to deal with. The reason for the poor rating is this, before my first visit to Tweeddale Motors I had arranged for a fitting in Penicuik. I went to get the tyres fitted and was told that [REDACTED] customers must leave the car for four hours after which the tyres will have been fitted ready for collection. I was unable to do this and said that I would have to return another day. Looking at the [REDACTED] website it stated that a queuing process would be in operation at this location, so I arrived at opening time a couple of days later, only to be told to collect the car in four hours time. Given the absence of customers and the information on the website I explained that I was unhappy with the service being offered and was told that if I did not wish to fit in with their procedure they would return the tyres which I agreed would probably be for the best. I spoke to [REDACTED] about this and, while very sympathetic and offering a discount on the price, they expressed no interest in including the fitting procedures in Penicuik on their website and indeed to this day it appears unchanged. I felt like a second class customer for using [REDACTED] in Penicuik, if the conditions were made plain on the website, I would have been able to make a different choice.

The tyres were fitted and balanced by my very experienced tyre man but I discovered that at speeds over 45mph the handlebars oscillated and this worsened until by 60mph it was unbearable. Tyre man removed, refitted and rebalanced the tyre but problem remained. Tyre man spotted that the tyre did not run true, the carcass was distorted. Tyre man fitted an old tyre and all was well, thus proving the new tyre was faulty. This was reported to [REDACTED] and they replaced the tyre and took the defective tyre for analysis.

12944,Excellent price service. Recently bought 2 new tires from [REDACTED].com & was very pleased with the price which was much cheaper than I could find any where else. Gave several places for the fitting service near me which was done as soon as we arrived & back on the road within 25 minutes. Only issue we had was that the tire pressure warning light was on after fitting. They said it will go out when I start driving but it did not. Stopped at a petrol station & found the new tires were well below the correct pressure. Perhaps if they are not sure of the pressure then they should ask the customer. Not a big issue & easily resolved. Highly recommend & wont hesitate to look there when I need anymore tires.,value for money,positive

13298,"Booked the tyres to be fitted by a mobile tyre fitter at my home as I wanted to keep the tyres already on the car. The first appointment was missed as the tyres hadn't arrived in stock in time. This was very frustrating as I wanted the new tyres for a road trip I was taking to Scotland.

At 11 o'clock that morning I received a call from the tyre fitters saying they hadn't received tyres from [REDACTED] (not true) and could they fit them tomorrow morning instead (Sunday). I said yes. The next day the tyre fitters didn't show up and I received no call whatsoever. I called them at around 4:45pm. They said they had broken down on the motorway and were going to call me that evening? I spoke to [REDACTED] who were deeply apologetic and arranged for the tyres to be fitted the following Saturday. I asked them not to use the same mobile tyre fitter as I didn't trust them but they did. The following Saturday arrived and once again, no one showed. I called [REDACTED] who called the tyre fitters. Once again the tyre fitters said they wouldn't be able to get to me and asked if they could come on Sunday again instead. Obviously I told them where to go. In the end we agreed that a local fitter to me would fit the tyres this Saturday. I went there and all appeared well. However when I collected the car some of the lacquer from two front wheels had been scuffed off! The tyre fitters came up with the reasons why but didn't actually apologise or accept blame. They said they will have a look at it this Friday. It's fair to say I have now given in. To be fair, throughout this whole situation, [REDACTED] customer service has actually been very good, especially from their call centre staff, and they have compensated me at each missed appointment.

Once again the tyre fitters said they wouldn't be able to get to me and asked if they could come on Sunday again instead. Obviously I told them where to go. In the end we agreed that a local fitter to me would fit the tyres this Saturday. I went there and all appeared well. However when I collected the car some of the lacquer from two front wheels had been scuffed off! The tyre fitters came up with the reasons why but didn't actually apologise or accept blame. They said they will have a look at it this Friday. It's fair to say I have now given in. To be fair, throughout this whole situation, [REDACTED] customer service has actually been very good, especially from their call centre staff, and they have compensated me at each missed appointment.

13301,"Booked the tyres to be fitted by a mobile tyre fitter at my home as I wanted to keep the tyres already on the car. The first appointment was missed as the tyres hadn't arrived in stock in time. This was very frustrating as I wanted the new tyres for a road trip I was taking to Scotland. We arranged to have the tyres fitted the following Saturday AM. At 11 o'clock that morning I received a call from the tyre fitters saying they hadn't received tyres from [REDACTED] (not true) and could they fit them tomorrow morning instead (Sunday). I said yes. The next day the tyre fitters didn't show up and I received no call whatsoever. I called them at around 4:45pm. They said they had broken down on the motorway and were going to call me that evening?

13419,Used many times before but never again. Ordered my tyres and selected my fitting date. Got an email to delay fitting date by 4 days because they claimed they couldn't get the tyres in that time. Arrived at selected garage on rearranged day and time and tyres hadn't arrived. Rang customer services and was told that the tyres were on the van and would be delivered later that day sometime. Fitting garage said they can get the tyres for the following day so I cancelled the [REDACTED] order and told the garage to order them in. They were paid for the tyres almost a week earlier but told me a refund would take 3-5 days. Told them this wasn't acceptable and the refund must be made that day. Tyres were fitted mid-day the following day and was told that the [REDACTED] tyres were delivered at the same time as the ones they ordered. I paid a 2% premium to get the tyres from a local garage but only pay when the job is finished. No brainer!,delivery punctuality,negative

So not the greeting I would have expected and why give a time slot then not adhere to it?Anyway there were two other customers in front of me in the waiting room when the manager came out and told them both exactly the same thing, their tracking was out but it can be rectified for a special price of £38 (approx as can’t remember exactly).

13501,"[REDACTED] OK McConechys not OK. Ordered up my new tyres from [REDACTED] online, good price and good prompt service from [REDACTED]. However, I made a massive mistake in choosing McConechy's, Sighthill, Edinburgh as the nominated tyre fitters. It is clear that as a [REDACTED] customer and not an actual McConechy's customer appearing at their workplace wanting your tyres fitted, you are in actual fact an annoyance to them and you are getting in their way.McConechy's fitted my tyres (although I'm very sure reluctantly).Upon being told by the tyre fitter that my car was now ready to go, I walked up to the car and noticed that there was no dustcaps fitted and had to request that 2 new dustcaps be fitted. I then left after being handed my tyre fitting paperwork.A day later I was checking the air pressures of my new tyres and then also noticed that McConechy's had not even changed the valve stems either. I contacted McConechy's about this and it was the tyre fitter that done the work that answered the phone. I told him that I noticed they had not changed the valve stems. I got this pathetic excuse about my existing valve stems being metal ones and he did not think I would have wanted rubber valve stems fitted, so he did not bother to change them and as an afterthought he stated ""but I changed the valve cores though"".I don't believe a word of that, what the tyre fitter guy doesn't know, is that I'm a fully qualified engineer and I know corner cutting when I see it. Remember I had to actually request that they fit dustcaps. Unfortunately I didn't notice McConechy's had not changed the valve stems at that time or I would have pulled them up right there and then.I know why he didn't change the valve stems, it is because they are all rusted up, badly corroded and might take a bit longer to remove and change over, maybe even some other problems that's why they were not changed and not his BS story about them being metal.I paid for 2 new tyres fitted and balanced with new valve stems and new valves fitted. That is not what I got.I got 2 new tyres fitted and balanced without new valve stems and a story that I don't believe about the valve cores being changed.But that makes it OK doesn't it ? NO, it certainly doesn't !Also states on the tyre fitting paperwork that the wheel nuts were torqued to 110nm. Well when I checked them 50 miles later, the wheel nuts were all at very different torque levels, the locking wheel nuts being the tightest by far.I do not believe for 1 second that the wheels were even torqued in the first place, more like slammed back on and racked up with the air gun.

13502,"[REDACTED] OK McConechys not OK. Ordered up my new tyres from [REDACTED] online, good price and good prompt service from [REDACTED].

It is clear that as a [REDACTED] customer and not an actual McConechy's customer appearing at their workplace wanting your tyres fitted, you are in actual fact an annoyance to them and you are getting in their way.McConechy's fitted my tyres (although I'm very sure reluctantly).Upon being told by the tyre fitter that my car was now ready to go, I walked up to the car and noticed that there was no dustcaps fitted and had to request that 2 new dustcaps be fitted. I then left after being handed my tyre fitting paperwork.A day later I was checking the air pressures of my new tyres and then also noticed that McConechy's had not even changed the valve stems either. I contacted McConechy's about this and it was the tyre fitter that done the work that answered the phone. I told him that I noticed they had not changed the valve stems. I got this pathetic excuse about my existing valve stems being metal ones and he did not think I would have wanted rubber valve stems fitted, so he did not bother to change them and as an afterthought he stated ""but I changed the valve cores though"".I don't believe a word of that, what the tyre fitter guy doesn't know, is that I'm a fully qualified engineer and I know corner cutting when I see it. Remember I had to actually request that they fit dustcaps. Unfortunately I didn't notice McConechy's had not changed the valve stems at that time or I would have pulled them up right there and then.I know why he didn't change the valve stems, it is because they are all rusted up, badly corroded and might take a bit longer to remove and change over, maybe even some other problems that's why they were not changed and not his BS story about them being metal.I paid for 2 new tyres fitted and balanced with new valve stems and new valves fitted. That is not what I got.I got 2 new tyres fitted and balanced without new valve stems and a story that I don't believe about the valve cores being changed.But that makes it OK doesn't it ? NO, it certainly doesn't !Also states on the tyre fitting paperwork that the wheel nuts were torqued to 110nm. Well when I checked them 50 miles later, the wheel nuts were all at very different torque levels, the locking wheel nuts being the tightest by far.I do not believe for 1 second that the wheels were even torqued in the first place, more like slammed back on and racked up with the air gun.

I said i booked Am and was told they dont do appointments. Do i sail i will return at 12 and was again told they dont do appointments. Their fitting bay at this point had 1 car in and nobody waiting and their own website takes appointments. Ive used them for 20 years but never again.

14313,"This is not a review of [REDACTED].com as such but my experience of the garage booked through them (A&S MOT Ltd).A terrible experience meaning I will never use A&S MOT Ltd again. Details of the issues are below.- Arranged and paid for two new tyres to be fitted and 4-wheel alignment as rear tyres wearing on inside- Took time off work and waited at garage. Work done and was given paperwork. Wheels dirty - but as expected- Left for work and steering wheel off-centre when going straight- Got to work and checked values on paperwork. Rear out of alignment and before/after figures unchanged- Left work early and returned to garage. Told rear not adjustable and the only way to do it is to fit new parts- Arranged to bring car back next day to sort steering- Rang Audi to ask about part required etc. and was told that all settings ARE adjustable by any competent garage, both front AND rear- Went to another wheel alignment place and asked them to confirm. They put car on ramp and within 30 seconds said the same and they didn't even need any specialist tools etc.- Took more time off work to return to A&S as agreed. Told them my findings re adjustment and they said they would sort it along with the off-centre steering wheel- When finished told ""all done"" - given no paperwork. Asked for printout and once received checked it whilst there. Rear STILL not adjusted- Asked for an explanation. Wasn't given one but told I would need to bring it back AGAIN- I then went on ~100 mile journey on which someone almost drove into me. I checked the dash cam. Found out it had been moved to point at the sky. Reviewed the footage and it was an employee at A&S that moved it prior to taking the car for a drive - I can only assume he wanted to drive it like he stole it- Cleaned car at the weekend afterwards and the gunk that was on the wheels was actually all over - especially one. Was also stuck on like glue. Took some fairly abrasive wheel cleaner and a lot of effort to remove- Checked the pressures of the new tyres - they had been set too high - higher than the maximum load pressures indicated on the car itselfIn summary, DON’T use this garage if you value your vehicle, time, money or safety.",value for money,positive
